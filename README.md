## Tech Stack
- Flutter SDK: 3.24.4
- State Management: Change Notifier Provider
- HTTP Client: http
- Persistence: shared_preferences

## State Management Explanation
- **Provider + ChangeNotifier**  
  - Chosen for its simplicity and suitability for apps with a moderate amount of mutable state.  
  - Allows listeners to rebuild only the parts of the UI that depend on changed data.  

- **Ephemeral State**  
  - Local widget state managed with `setState` where appropriate for UI-specific changes.

## Known Issues / Limitations
- Caching of API responses is not implementedâ€”every refresh fetches data from the network.
- No pagination; large data sets may affect performance.
- Error handling and offline support can be improved.
- Search Feature can be improved.
- SQFlite can be used to access previously fetched data offline.
